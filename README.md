# Infinython

Infinython is a template for a simple Python project created using 
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). It will generate a project
with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) configured, so you should consider [installing it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

## Requirements

You will only need to have Cookiecutter installed. This can be easily done by following the 
[official installation instructions](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#install-cookiecutter).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raphaellndr/infinython.git
    ```

2. Run Cookiecutter to generate a Python project:

    ```bash
    cookiecutter infinython
    ```

   Cookiecutter will prompt you for values for the project variables defined in `cookiecutter.json`. Fill in the values as needed.


## Running the Project
